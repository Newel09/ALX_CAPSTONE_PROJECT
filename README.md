# Shop API — Feature Summary
Shop API — Feature Summary

When built, this application will provide the following capabilities:

 User authentication: register, login, and view own profile (token-based).
 Manage shopping lists: create, rename, archive, delete, and list user-owned shopping lists.
 Manage list items: add items to lists, update quantity/unit/category, mark bought/unbought, and delete items.
 Budget tracking: set an optional budget per shopping list and store estimated unit prices per item.
 Summary endpoint: return list totals, estimated cost, budget, remaining amount, and basic counts.
 Optional integrations (post-MVP): fetch price suggestions from external product APIs, share lists with roles, and basic analytics (most-bought items, category totals).
